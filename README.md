# Sickle Cell Detection Using InceptionV3

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for detecting sickle cell anemia (SCA) using blood smear images. By leveraging the **InceptionV3** architecture, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we classify images as either positive (sickle cells detected) or negative (normal cells). A **Streamlit-based web application** is included for an intuitive user interface.

## **Project Overview**
Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder affecting the shape and functionality of red blood cells. Crescent or sickle-shaped cells can block blood flow, leading to severe complications. This project aims to:
1. Provide a **deep learning-based solution** for early detection using blood smear images.
2. Build a **Streamlit-based web application** for seamless interaction.
3. Achieve high accuracy and reliability in detecting SCA to support medical professionals.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Image Classification**: Upload blood smear images to classify as positive or negative for sickle cell anemia.
- **Interactive Web Application**:
  - Developed in **Streamlit** for an easy-to-use interface.
  - Allows for real-time predictions and visualizations.
- **Visualization**: Probability scores and predictions are visualized with bar charts.
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieves a classification accuracy of **98.89%**, with strong precision, recall, and F1 scores.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (for model development and application backend)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (model building and training)
- **Streamlit** (interactive web application)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (visualizations)
- **ImageDataGenerator** (data augmentation for training)

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset consists of labeled blood smear images divided into two categories:
- **Positive**: Images with visible sickle cells.
- **Negative**: Images of normal blood cells.

### **Dataset Preparation**
- Ensure the dataset is organized into subfolders:
  ```
  /data
    /Positive
    /Negative
  ```
- Images will be automatically split into training, validation, and testing sets during preprocessing.

### **Data Augmentation**
To enhance the robustness of the model, we used **ImageDataGenerator** for:
- Horizontal and vertical flips.
- Random rotations.
- Scaling and zooming.

---

## **Model Training**
The **InceptionV3** model was fine-tuned with custom layers for binary classification. Key steps include:
1. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction.
   - Fine-tuned on the blood smear dataset for SCA detection.
2. **Loss Function**:
   - Binary cross-entropy.
3. **Optimizer**:
   - Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.

### **Training Pipeline**
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform data augmentation.
3. Fine-tune the InceptionV3 model.
4. Evaluate performance metrics.

---

## **Web Application**
The web application is built with **Streamlit**, enabling users to interact with the model in real time.

### **Features**
- **Image Upload**: Upload a medical image of blood cells.
- **Model Prediction**: The application displays the classification (positive/negative) with probabilities.
- **Probability Visualization**: A bar chart visualizes the confidence scores for each class.
